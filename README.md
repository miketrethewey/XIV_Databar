# XIV_Databar
#### !! ATTENTION !!
When downloading from Github, you'll have to **rename the folder XIV_Databar-master in the .zip to XIV_Databar** or WoW won't be able to detect the AddOn.

Once I've finished my to-do list I intend to upload this AddOn to Curseforge so the poor Twitch App users can auto-download again.

#### TO-DO LIST:
- Bugfixes as they come up
- ~~[Armor] Change average durability to lowest durability~~
- [Tradeskill] Allow user to show/hide first/second/cooking profession, able to show all 3
- [Currency] Add important currencies to the currency tooltip
- [Currency] Add better currency icons for SL currencies
- [Currency] Move currency module to the left side, between the armor and talent modules
- [Travel] Add teleport options and fix various bugs and inconsistencies of the travel module
